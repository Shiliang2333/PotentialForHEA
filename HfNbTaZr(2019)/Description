This is a LAMMPS readable EAM potential file for the Hf-Nb-Ta-Zr high-entropy alloy (HEA). This potential has been used in the paper on HEA published on the local short-range order and related properties. (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2016.01.018)

In the 4-element potential file, the required embedding energy, electron density and pairwise interaction tables are sequenced such that the first element is Hf, second Nb, third Ta and fourth one is Zr. The energy unit is in eV/atom and distance has the unit of Angstrom. The electron density functions can be treated as unit less numbers. The electron density and pairwise interactions were tabulated for a maximum cutoff distance of 5 Angstrom. The pair interaction function is multiplied by distance r as per the requirements of LAMMPS format. The tables of this alloy potential file are prepared based some physical input parameters of pure elements like lattice parameter, cohesive energy, elastic constants etc by following the procedure given by Bangwei et al (Z. Bangwei, O. Yifang, Physical Review B 48 (1993) 3022-3028).
